These patches will convert a European (EU) BN6 ROM to the United States (US) version of BN6. If you have an EU ROM, this will make it capable of connecting for online netbattles.

There is a separate patch file for each Cybeast version. You must use the patch that matches the Cybeast version for your ROM.

Run the included Lunar IPS.exe program and apply the correct IPS patch to your ROM.
