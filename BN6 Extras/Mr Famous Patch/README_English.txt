====== HOW TO USE

1) Place the IPS files in the same folder as your BN6/EXE6 roms

2) Make sure each IPS file has the same file name as the GBA rom it will be applied to
   Example:  "BN6 Falzar.IPS" & "BN6 Falzar.GBA" 

3) VBA-Link will automatically apply the patch temporarily when the game is opened.

   The patch can be enabled or disabled by toggling this setting: 
   'Options' -> 'Emulator' -> 'Automatic IPS patching'
   
   When 'Automatic IPS patching' is ticked, the patch will be applied.

   The ROM files will not be modified when they're applied with this method.




====== PATCH FEATURES

The "Triple Battle" pvp mode is changed to allow continual back-to-back matches without either player being forced to disconnect until someone wins 69 times or experiences a connection error.


The "Random Battle" pvp mode will also allow for continual battles with the same folder.


When connecting with someone who has not applied the patch, the patched game will behave like it's vanilla. The patch will not cause desyncs.
