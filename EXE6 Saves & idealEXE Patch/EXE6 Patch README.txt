The saves and patches in this folder are meant for the Japanese version of Battle Network 6, referred to as EXE6. 

--- The provided IdealEXE patch has the followings effects:

- Translates an EXE6 ROM to display in English.

- Allows you to easily equip ModCards by interacting with the computer in Lan's room.

- Enables the Mr Famous patch by default, allowing you to continually netbattle without disconnecting after 2 wins.

- Crashes the game in many areas if you attempt to explore the net or play through the singleplayer mode. The patch is only safe for multiplayer, and has been confirmed to have stability issues when used for other purposes.


--- How to use:

Launch the included program "flips.exe" to apply the .bps file over a clean, unpatched copy of EXE6.

EXE6 is typically only used while playing the ModCards format. For regular matches, use the US version of BN6. 

To play the ModCards format with other netbattlers, use the matchmaking channel in the N1GP Discord server and ask if someone would like to play a round of ModCards.
