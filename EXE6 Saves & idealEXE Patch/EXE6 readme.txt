The saves and patches in this folder are meant for the Japanese version of Battle Network 6, referred to as EXE6. 

The provided patches will translate an EXE6 ROM to display in English. In addition, it will allow you to easily equip ModCards by interacting with the computer in Lan's room.

Launch the included program to apply the .bps file over a clean, unpatched copy of EXE6.


EXE6 is typically only used while playing the ModCards format. For regular matches, use the US version of BN6.
