EXE6 infamous patch

These patch files are provided for those who would like to disable the mr famous patch that is included in the idealEXE patch for EXE6. By disabling mr famous, the pvp battles will revert from 69 Battles back to Triple Battles.

To use this patch, apply it over a ROM that has already had the idealEXE patch applied.

And remember, this patch will not break compatibility with other players. When netbattling with players who have the mr famous patch enabled, the match will still behave like a normal Triple Battle.
