These patches are for ROMs that were extracted from the WiiU Virtual Console. Use the corresponding patch for your WiiU ROM to revert it back to a standard "vanilla" version of the game that will be able to play online in Tango.

You must ensure that you're selecting the correct patch that is meant for your ROM's version and localization.

The letters in parenthesis in the patch names mean specific things:
(UE) - works with both the US (global) and European localizations of the ROM
(J) - works with only the Japanese localization of the ROM
(U) - works with only the US (global) localization of the ROM
(E) - works with only the European localization of the ROM

Run the included flips.exe program and apply the correct patch to your ROM.
